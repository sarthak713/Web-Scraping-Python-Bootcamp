'''
The Request Response Cycle

- use HTTPie = API testing client
- this sends request to specifies URL and the server sends back some content
- the browser interprets that content to look like the webpage but underneath is just text that is sent to client
- Client sends request, server sends response & each req-res cycle is in itself stateless (independent of any other requests)
